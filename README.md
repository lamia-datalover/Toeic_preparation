# Toeic_preparation
Mastering English is a must nowadays, especially in the tech field. The interesting videos, tutorials, and scientific articles are in English. I won't lie to you; I had a good level in English, but the following books helped me boost my English and, most importantly, pass my English exam: the TOEIC, by achieving a score of 945 out of 990.

I recommend you to buy them if you have the opportunity to do so. Do not get me wrong; you can also prepare for the test using videos on YouTube, but I am a big fan of books. I always need to highlight the pages to feel that I am on the right path. Yeah, I am not proud of it, but this is me, so...

I also recommend you to talk in english with a friend and most impotantly this person should be supportive and gently corrects your mistakes without making fun of you.

Please keep in mind that it is okay to make mistakes; English is not your native language. Do not pay attention to those who try to belittle you. The most important thing is to evolve, and each person has his/her own pace. Be proud of your story and your efforts! Sending lots of love to you if you feel that you are struggling and always trying your best to get there. I really believe in you, even if I do not know you, because I strongly believe that hard work will always pay off sooner or later!
